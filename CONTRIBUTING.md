### Commit messages

Pact Go uses the [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md)
message conventions. Please ensure you follow the guidelines.

If you'd like to get some CLI assistance, getting setup is easy:

```shell
npm install commitizen -g
npm i -g cz-conventional-changelog
```

`git cz` to commit and commitizen will guide you.

### Developing

For full integration testing locally, Ruby 2.2.0 must be installed. Under the
hood, Pact Go bundles the
[Pact Mock Service](https://github.com/bethesque/pact-mock_service) and
[Pact Provider Verifier](https://github.com/teetachp/pact-provider-verifier)
projects to implement up to v2.0 of the Pact Specification. This is only
temporary, until [Pact Reference](https://github.com/teetachp/pact-reference/)
work is completed.

* Git clone https://github.com/teetachp/pact-go.git
* Run `make dev` to build the package and setup the Ruby 'binaries' locally

#### Vendoring

We use [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to vendor packages. Please ensure
any new packages that need to have a specific version locked are added to `Gopkg.toml`.

## Integration Tests

Before releasing a new version, in addition to the standard (isolated) tests
we smoke test the key features against the latest code and Broker.

Run `make pact` to run the integration tests.
