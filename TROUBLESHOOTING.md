# Troubleshooting

Here we can find common issues and how to solve them.

## Bodies match and only differ by whitespace/formatting

An example error might look like this:

```	  
1) Verifying a pact between service-one and service-two Given User traffic exists for the current month A request for all traffic for the current month with GET /v1/traffic/usage/json returns a response which has a matching body

The problem is that there is no `Content-Type` being sent through to inform the underlying validation library how to compare requests/response. In this case, it defaults to `text/plain` which is sensitive to differences.

You likely want `application/json` or similar, to compare JSON payloads e.g.

```
		WillRespondWith(dsl.Response{
			Status: 200,
			Headers: map[string]string{
				"Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
			},
			Body: `[{
				    "org": "a6df0d8e-916b-4998-ac6e-149b299e2c9f",
                                    "usage": 12345
			       }]`,
		})
```
